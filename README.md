# Monitoring Resources Using Psutil

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to monitor various resources of your device using the `psutil` package in Python. This includes monitoring CPU, GPU, memory, disks, network, and sensors. Additionally, it explores the `multiprocessing` package to evaluate the advantages of parallelism in resource monitoring.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this experiment, you will be able to:

- Understand what monitoring your device means
- Explore various functions of the `psutil` package
- Explore the `multiprocessing` package
- Evaluate the advantages of parallelism using `psutil`

## What does monitoring your device mean?

Monitoring your device involves keeping track of various system resources and their utilization. These resources include:

- **CPU**: Monitor the usage and performance of the central processing unit.
- **GPU**: Monitor the usage and performance of the graphical processing unit.
- **Memory**: Track the usage of RAM, swap space, and hard disk space.
- **Disks**: Monitor disk usage and performance.
- **Network**: Track network activity and usage.
- **Sensors**: Monitor various system sensors, such as temperature sensors.

## Files

- **Monitoring_Resources_using_Psutil.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook file that contains the code and explanations for monitoring system resources using the `psutil` package.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the notebook, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- `psutil` package
- `multiprocessing` package (comes with Python's standard library)

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```sh
pip install psutil
```

### Running the Notebook

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Praveen76/Monitoring-resources-using-Psutil.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

```sh
cd Monitoring-resources-using-Psutil
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```sh
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open the `Monitoring_Resources_using_Psutil.ipynb` notebook and run the cells to explore the resource monitoring code and explanations.
